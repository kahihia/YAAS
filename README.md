# YAAS
Yet Another Auction Site

This is a website project I made for the course Development of web applications and web services. It was built using python and the Django framework. The idea is the provide an auction site where people can register as users and auction their items to the highest bidder.

Some features YAAS implements:
- Register and log in as different users
- Edit user account email and password
- Create a new auction to the site
- Edit a created auction's information
- Browse and search existing auctions
- Bid on other users' auctions
- Admins can ban auctions
- The system automatically resolves auctions when their deadline hits
- Support for multiple languages
- Support for multiple concurrent sessions
- Support for currency exchange
