# YAAS
Yet Another Auction Site

This is a website project I made for the course Development of web applications and web services. It was built using python and the Django framework.

Some features YAAS implements:
- Register and log in as different users
- Edit user account email and password
- Create a new auction to the site
- Edit a created auction's information
- Browse and search existing auctions
- Bid on other users' auctions
- Admins can ban auctions
- The system automatically resolves auctions when their deadline hits
- support for multiple languages
- support for multiple concurrent sessions
- support for currency exchange
